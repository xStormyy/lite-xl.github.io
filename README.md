# [Lite XL][1] website

This website is built with markdown and a tiny ruby script
as a static site generator.

## Local Build Quick-start Guide

- Install ruby.
- Install the `redcarpet` and `rouge` gems.
  You can install them with `gem install redcarpet rouge`.
- Run `site.rb`. It should generate the website in-place.
  You'll need a HTTP server[₁][2][₂][3] to preview it.

> If you use `python3`'s `http.server`, the links on the website
> may not work correctly as `http.server` requires
> the full filename (with the `.html` file extension)
> while the website does not use that.
> `http-server` does not have this limitation.

## Extra goodies

#### Auto updates

Get [watchexec][5] for watching directories.

```sh
$ watchexec -e md,html -w locales -w assets ./site.rb
```

#### Configuring site.rb

For normal usage you don't need to configure the script at all.
However, some of the behavior can be changed via environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Description
| -------------------- | -----------
| `SITE_ROOT`          | Change the output path of the script\*.
| `SITE_DOMAIN`        | Change the domain used in `sitemap.txt`.
| `SITE_LOCALE`        | Change the default locale of the website.
| `VERBOSE`            | Enable verbose logging.

\* This does not change the URL in generated HTML files.
