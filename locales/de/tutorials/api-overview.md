# API Overview

### This is a work in progress.

Here we provide some resources and explanation to some API and aspects of Lite XL.
For API docs, it's available in [the repo][1]
Thus, we'll not explain _everything_, only the more important and frequently used features.

Built-in APIs:

- [Process API][2]
- [System API][3]
- [Regex API][4]
