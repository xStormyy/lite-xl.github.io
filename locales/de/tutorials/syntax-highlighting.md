# Syntax Highlighting

## How to create syntax highlighting plugins for Lite XL

Syntax highlighting plugins for Lite XL are Lua files. These define some patterns or regular expressions that
match different parts of a given language, assigning token types to each match.
These different token types are then given different colors by your chosen color scheme.

Like other plugins, syntax definitions are sourced from the following folders, in order:

- `/usr/share/lite-xl/plugins/`
- `$HOME/.config/lite-xl/plugins/`

NOTE: The exact location of these folders will depend on your OS and installation method. For example, on Windows, the variable `$USERPROFILE` will be used instead of `$HOME`.

The user module folder for Lite XL can generally be found in these places on different OSes:

- Windows: `C:\Users\(username)\.config\lite-xl`
- MacOS: `/Users/(usernmame)/.config/lite-xl`
- Linux: `/home/(username)/.config/lite-xl`

So, to create a new syntax definition on Linux, you can just create a `.lua` file in your `$HOME/.config/lite-xl/plugins/` folder.

## What syntax token types are supported?

The supported syntax token types, defined by `lite-xl/core/style.lua`, are:

- normal
- symbol
- comment
- keyword
- keyword2
- number
- literal
- string
- operator
- function

In your syntax highlighting plugin, you write patterns to match parts of the language syntax, assigning these token types to matches. You don't have to use them all - just use as many as you need for your language.

Let's walk through an example syntax definition and see how this works.

## Example syntax: ssh config files

This is a small, simple example of a syntax definition. It's intended to highlight SSH Config files and looks like this:

```lua
-- mod-version:2 -- lite-xl 2.0
local syntax = require "core.syntax"

syntax.add {
  files = { "sshd?/?_?config$" },
  comment = '#',
  patterns = {
    { pattern = "#.*\n",        type = "comment"  },
    { pattern = "%d+",          type = "number"   },
    { pattern = "[%a_][%w_]*",  type = "symbol"   },
    { pattern = "@",            type = "operator" },
  },
  symbols = {
    -- ssh config
    ["Host"]                         = "function",
    ["ProxyCommand"]                 = "function",

    ["HostName"]                     = "keyword",
    ["IdentityFile"]                 = "keyword",
    ...

    -- sshd config
    ["Subsystem"]                    = "keyword2",

    -- Literals
    ["yes"]      = "literal",
    ["no"]       = "literal",
    ["any"]      = "literal",
    ["ask"]      = "literal",
  },
}
```

Let's take each section in turn and see how it works.

### Header

The first line is a Lua comment & tells Lite XL which version this plugin requires. The second imports the `core.syntax` module
for us to use:

```lua
-- mod-version:2 -- lite-xl 2.0
local syntax = require "core.syntax"
```

We then add a syntax definition to lite, using `syntax.add {...}`. The contents of this definition are covered next.

#### Files

The `files` property tells Lite XL which files this syntax should be used for. This is a Lua pattern that matches against the full path of the file being opened. For example, to match against Markdown files - with either a `.md` or a `.markdown` extension,
you could do this:

```lua
files = { "%.md$", "%.markdown$" },
```

In our original example, we match against the end of the path rather than the extension, because SSH config files don't have extensions - and we don't want to match all `config` files. We expect the path for SSH config files to look something like one of these:

- `~/.ssh/config`
- `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`
- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

This pattern matches paths that look like that:

```lua
files = { "sshd?/?_?config$" },
```

### Comment

The comment property _doesn't_ define which parts of the syntax are comments - see Patterns for that, below. This property tells Lite XL which character to insert at the start of selected lines when you press `ctrl+/`.
You can also use `block_comment` to tell Lite XL how to create multiline / block comments.

### Patterns

A given piece of text can only match one pattern. Once Lite XL decides that a piece of text matches a pattern, it will assign that token type to that piece and move on.
Patterns are tested in the order that they are written in the syntax definition, so the first match will win.

Each pattern takes one of the following forms:

#### Simple Pattern

```lua
{ pattern = "#.*\n",        type = "comment" },
```

This form matches the line against the pattern and if it matches, assigns the matching text to the given token `type` - `comment`, in this case.

#### Start & End Pattern

```lua
{ pattern = { "%[", "%]" }, type = "keyword" },
```

This form has two patterns - one that matches against the start of the range and one that matches against the end. Everything between the start and the end will be assigned the given token `type`.

#### Start & End Pattern, with Escape

```lua
{ pattern = { '"', '"', '\\' }, type = "string" },
```

This is the same as the previous form, but with an extra, third parameter.
The 3rd part, the `'\\'` part in this example, specifies the character that allows escaping the closing match.

For more on Lua Patterns, see: [Lua Pattern Reference](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.1)

If you need to use PCRE Regular Expressions, instead of Lua Patterns, you can use the `regex` keyword here, instead of `pattern`.

### Symbols

> This is **not related to the `symbol` token type**.

The symbols section allows you to assign token types to particular keywords or strings - usually reserved words in the language you are highlighting.
The token type in this section **always take precedence** over token types declared in patterns.

For example this highlights `Host` using the `function` token type, `HostName` as a `keyword` and `yes`, `no`, `any` & `ask` as a `literal`:

```lua
["Host"]                         = "function",
["HostName"]                     = "keyword",

["yes"]      = "literal",
["no"]       = "literal",
["any"]      = "literal",
["ask"]      = "literal",
```

#### Tips: double check your patterns!

There are a few common mistakes that can be made when using the `symbols` table in conjunction with patterns.

##### Case 1: Spaces between two `symbols` tokens

Let's have an example:

```lua
{ pattern = "[%a_][%w_]+%s+()[%a_][%w_]+", type = { "keyword2", "symbol" } }
```

Let's explain the pattern a bit (omitting the empty parentheses):

```
[%a_] = any alphabet and underscore
[%w_] = any alphabet, numbers and underscore
%s = any whitespace character

WORD =
  [%a_] followed by (1 or more [%w_])

pattern =
  WORD followed by (one or more %s) followed by WORD
```

Afterwards, you add an entry `["my"] = "literal"` in the `symbols` table.
You test the syntax with `my function` found that `"my"` isn't highlighted as `literal`. Why did that happen?

**`symbols` table requires an exact match**.
If you look carefully, the empty parentheses (`()`) is placed **after the space**!
This tells Lite XL that `WORD followed by (one or more %s)` is a token, which will match `my ` (note the space in the match).

The fix is to add a `normal` token for the whitespace between the two tokens:

```lua
{ pattern = "[%a_][%w_]+()%s+()[%a_][%w_]+", type = { "keyword2", "normal", "symbol" } }
```

##### Case 2: Patterns & `symbols` tokens

One might assume that Lite XL magically matches text against the `symbols` table. This is not the case.

In some languages, people may add a generic pattern to delegate the matching to the `symbols` table.

```lua
{ pattern = "[%a_][%w_]*", "symbol" }
```

However, the `symbols` table may look like this:

```lua
symbols = {
  ["my-symbol"] = "function",
  ["..something_else"] = "literal"
}
```

`"my-symbol` contains a dash (`-`) and `"..something_else"` contains 2 dots (`.`).
None of the characters are matched by `[%a_][%w_]*`!

**Beware of the text you intend to match in the `symbols` table.**
**If you want to use it, you need to ensure that it can matched by one of the patterns.**

The correct patterns are:

```lua
{ pattern = "[%a_][%w%-_]*", "symbol" },
{ pattern = "%.%.[%a_][%w_]*", "symbol" },
```

## Testing Your New Syntax

To test your new syntax highlighting you need to do two things:

- Reload the Lite XL core
- Load a file in your chosen language and see how it looks

To reload the core, you can either restart Lite XL, or reload the core from the command palette, without needing to restart.
To do this, type `ctrl+shit+p` to show the command palette, then select `Core: Restart` (or type `crr` or something similar to match it), then press Enter. You will need to restart the core after any changes you make to the syntax highlighting definition.


## Example advanced syntax: Markdown

> **Note: This example has features from 2.1. It is not compatible with older versions of lite-xl.**

Not all languages are as simple as SSH config files. Markup languages like HTML and Markdown are especially hard to parse correctly. Here's the markdown syntax file in its full glory:

```lua
-- mod-version:3
local syntax = require "core.syntax"
local style = require "core.style"
local core = require "core"

local initial_color = style.syntax["keyword2"]

-- Add 3 type of font styles for use on markdown files
for _, attr in pairs({"bold", "italic", "bold_italic"}) do
  local attributes = {}
  if attr ~= "bold_italic" then
    attributes[attr] = true
  else
    attributes["bold"] = true
    attributes["italic"] = true
  end
  -- no way to copy user custom font with additional attributes :(
  style.syntax_fonts["markdown_"..attr] = renderer.font.load(
    DATADIR .. "/fonts/JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf",
    style.code_font:get_size(),
    attributes
  )
  -- also add a color for it
  style.syntax["markdown_"..attr] = style.syntax["keyword2"]
end

local in_squares_match = "^%[%]"
local in_parenthesis_match = "^%(%)"

syntax.add {
  name = "Markdown",
  files = { "%.md$", "%.markdown$" },
  block_comment = { "<!--", "-->" },
  space_handling = false, -- turn off this feature to handle it our selfs
  patterns = {
  ---- Place patterns that require spaces at start to optimize matching speed

    end
    coroutine.yield(1)
  end
end)
```

### Syntax fonts (Since 1.16.10)

The syntax allows users to set different font styles (bold, italic, etc.) for different patterns.
To change the font style of a token, add a Font to `style.syntax_fonts[token_type]`.
For example:
```
-- will ensure every "fancysyntax_fancy_token" is italic
style.syntax_fonts["fancysyntax_fancy_token"] = renderer.font.load("myfont.ttf", 14 * SCALE, { italic = true })
```

The markdown example automates this with a for loop.

The limitations here are that fonts cannot be copied with different attributes, thus the font path has to be hardcoded.
Other than that, abusing `style.syntax_fonts` may lead to **slow performance** and **high memory consumption**.
This is very obvious when the user tries to resize the editor with `ctrl-scroll` or `ctrl+` and `ctrl-`.
Please use it in moderation.

### Space handling (v2.1 (upcoming) / `master`)

By default, Lite XL prepends a pattern `{ pattern = "%s+", type = "normal" }` to the syntax.
This improves the performance drastically on lines that starts with whitespaces (eg. heavily indented lines)
by matching the whitespace before other patterns in order to prevent Lite XL from iterating the entire syntax.
However, there may be syntaxes that require matching spaces (eg. Markdown with indented blocks)
so this can be disabled by setting `space_handling` to `false.`

> To keep the space handling optimization or to support older versions of Lite XL,
> `{ pattern = "%s+", type = "normal" }` can be added after patterns that require space.

### Simple patterns with multiple tokens (v1.16.10)

This is an excerpt taken from the markdown plugin:

```lua
local in_squares_match = "^%[%]"
-- reference links
{
  pattern = "^%s*%[%^()["..in_squares_match.."]+()%]: ",
  type = { "function", "number", "function" }
},
```

Sometimes it makes sense to highlight different parts of a pattern differently.
An empty parentheses (`()`) in Lua patterns will return the position of the text in the parentheses.
This will tell Lite XL when to change the type of token.
For instance, `^%s*%[%^` is `"function"`, `["..in_squares_match.."]+` is `"number"` and `%]: ` is `"function"`.

### Subsyntaxes (Since v1.16.10)

Lite XL supports embedding another syntax into the existing syntax.
This is used to support code blocks inside the markdown syntax.

For example:
```lua
{ pattern = { "```cpp", "```" },        type = "string", syntax = ".cpp" },
```

This would highlight `` ```cpp `` and `` ``` `` with `"string"` while everything inside them will be highlighted with a syntax that matches `".cpp"`.
