# FAQ

#### Can I get smart autocompletion (intellisense/LSP)?

Check out the [LSP] plugin.

#### Where is the integrated terminal?

You can try [lite-xl-terminal].

#### Tabs and indent size?

In your user config (the cog icon in the file tree):

```lua
config.tab_type = "soft" -- soft for spaces, hard for real tabs (\t)
config.indent_size = 4   -- 4 spaces
```

#### How to bind commands to keys?

```lua
local keymap = require "core.keymap"
keymap.add { ["ctrl+escape"] = "core:quit" }
```

#### How to unbind commands for certain keys?

```lua
-- the second parameter lets you override commands for certain keys
-- in this case it maps it to nothing
keymap.add({ ["ctrl+escape"] = {} }, true)
```

#### How to get commands for those keybinds?

You can search for commands in the command palette.

For each command, replace the spaces in the right side with dashes.

For example: `Core: Find Command` â†’ `core:find-command`

Lua 5.4.
